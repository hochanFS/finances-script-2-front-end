# financescript-2-front-end

The goal of this repository is to develop the front-end engine for FinanceScript. For full-stack repository, please see https://github.com/hochanFS/financescript-2

A reader may only be interested in knowing the steps I have followed for exclusively either front-end or back-end, but not both. That is a primary reason why I have decied to separate the project into two repositories.
